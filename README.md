# Python Data Cleaning Portfolio

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline in Python
using a fully synthetic marketing dataset.

The notebook simulates common real-world data issues and shows how to systematically clean,
validate, and enrich raw data before analysis.

## What This Project Covers

- Synthetic data generation (no external data required)
- Column name standardization
- Currency and numeric type conversion
- Categorical value normalization
- Boolean value cleaning
- Boolean normalization
- Robust date parsing with error handling
- Logical data integrity checks
- Outlier handling using IQR
- Feature engineering with regular expressions

## Tech Stack

- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- Jupyter Notebook

## Notes

All data used in this project is synthetically generated within the notebook.
